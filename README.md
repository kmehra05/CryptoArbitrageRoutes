# Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Routes

## Project Overview
Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Routes is a system that leverages a custom implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the most profitable arbitrage opportunities across various cryptocurrency exchanges. By exploiting the price differences of the same asset on different markets (bid/ask spread), the tool helps visualize the most lucrative path considering potential gains.

## Features
- **Data Integration:** Real-time and historical pricing data from multiple exchanges are integrated using ccxt.
- **Graph Construction:** Constructs a dynamic graph with networkx where nodes represent exchange/ticker pairs, and edges denote potential arbitrage opportunities, factoring in the inverse of the profitability multiplier as the edge weight to easily be used for Djikstraâ€™s algorithm with the purpose of maximum path length rather than minimum path length.
- **Path Optimization:** Utilizes a custom implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm tailored for maximizing profitability by considering the compounded effect of consecutive arbitrage opportunities by multiplying edge weights to determine path length instead of summing.
- **Interactive GUI:** Users can select cryptocurrencies to analyze and visualize the optimal arbitrage path starting from a chosen ticker and exchange, with profit metrics shown.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **ccxt:** Library used for fetching data from various exchanges.
- **networkx:** Facilitates the construction and manipulation of complex network graphs.
- **Tkinter:** For creating the GUI
- **matplotlib:** For visualizing the results and optimal paths graphically in the GUI

## Installation
Refer to `INSTALL.md` for detailed installation and setup instructions.

## Limitations
- **Theoretical Application:** The current implementation does not account for transaction costs, which affects profitability metrics that are outputted.
- **Performance:** Due to computational complexity, the scalability is currently limited, affecting performance with large sets of tickers.
- **Exchange Coverage:** Initially configured for two exchanges, but expandable via modifications in `fetch_data.py`.

## Usage
To run the project:
```bash
python main.py
```
